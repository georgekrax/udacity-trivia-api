# Full Stack API Final Project

## Full Stack Trivia :rocket:

Trivia is a Question and Answers application, or more likely a quiz. It uses React for the frontend and Python with Flask for the backend, which is a CRUD operations API. This project was created for Trivia API Project in Udacity's Nanodegree Program for Course 3: API Development and Documentation. You can find more information on the README.md files specifically for the frontend and the backend on their directories.

### Backend

The `./backend` directory contains a partially completed Flask and SQLAlchemy server. You will work primarily in app.py to define your endpoints and can reference models.py for DB and SQLAlchemy setup.

[View the README.md within ./backend for more details.](./frontend/README.md)

### Frontend

The `./frontend` directory contains a complete React frontend to consume the data from the Flask server. You will need to update the endpoints after you define them in the backend. Those areas are marked with TODO and can be searched for expediency. 

Pay special attention to what data the frontend is expecting from each API response to help guide how you format your API.
